# **Details**



I've tryed my best to remove any passwords from the archives and to make sure nothing is infected.
I don't guarantee the *"safeness"* of any of the archives, builders, or anything in this repo, while you should be safe, I recommend using a VM or Sandbox.
Many projects are duplicates or revisions of each other. Many of them may have outdated depedencies.


I'm not responsible for anything you do with this.
**ITS YOUR FAULT**, if you use this for any illegal purpose.
